# 🛡️ Wazuh SIEM & File Integrity Monitoring Home Lab

## 📌 Overview
This project demonstrates the setup of **Wazuh**, an open-source SIEM platform, in a virtual lab environment for:
- ✅ Log analysis
- ✅ File Integrity Monitoring (FIM)
- ✅ Basic security event detection

It serves as a **beginner-friendly cybersecurity project** to understand SIEM concepts and how agents collect logs/events for centralized monitoring.

## 🏗️ Lab Architecture
- **Wazuh Manager** → Ubuntu Server (VirtualBox)
- **Wazuh Agent** → Windows VM
- **Networking** → Bridged Adapter (both VMs on same LAN)
